        <B>1. What is JVM? Why is Java called the "Platform Independent Programming Language‚Äù?</B>
       <ul>
A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a process virtual machine that can execute Java bytecode.Each Java source file is compiled into a bytecode file, which is executed by the JVM. Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform, without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform.
A Java virtual machine makes this possible because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the underlying hardware platform.
</ul>

   <li>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is the full-featured Software Development Kit for Java, including the JRE, the compilers, and tools (like JavaDoc, and Java Debugger), in order for a user to develop, compile and execute Java applications.</li></ul>

    <b>5. What is the difference between an Applet and a Java Application? </b>
    <ul  type="bullet">
    A Java Server Page (JSP) is a text document that contains two types of text:
       <li>Applets are executed within a Java-enabled browser.</li> 
       <li>Java application is a standalone Java program that can be executed outside of a browser.</li>

    <b>6. What is JDBC? </b>
    <ul>
